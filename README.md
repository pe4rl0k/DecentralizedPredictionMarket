The DecentralizedPredictionMarket is a Solidity-based smart contract designed to facilitate participation in predictive markets in a trustless and decentralized manner. This contract enables users to create prediction markets with specific titles, options, and deadlines. Participants can place their bets on various outcomes, with the assurance that they can bet only once per market. After the betting period concludes, the market creator has the authority to declare the winning option. Rewards are then distributed among the winners proportionally, based on the total betting pool. The contract is equipped with events for comprehensive tracking of actions and includes functions for accessing detailed market information and current bet amounts. This platform opens up a transparent and fair avenue for users to engage in forecasting and prediction markets on the blockchain.
